Machine Learning Calculators for Electric Vehicles In India

Calculator 1 - Range Calculator

This calculator compares the Actual range vs. Predicted range of EVs in India. It considers variables such as speed (km/hr), ambient temperature (Celsius), and whether the air conditioning is active. The calculator helps users understand how real-world conditions affect the range of their vehicles compared to the manufacturer's predictions.

Usage:

Speed (km/hr): Enter the speed of the vehicle.
Temperature (Celsius): Provide the ambient temperature.
AC Active: Specify if the air conditioning is on.
Objective: To assist users in assessing the efficiency of EVs under various conditions and promote the shift from conventional vehicles to EVs.

Calculator 2 - Cost Calculator

This tool calculates the cost to fully charge an EV in different states across India. It factors in the varying electricity rates and the specific power requirements of the EV.

Usage:

Select State: Choose the state to get the applicable electricity rate.
Vehicle Model: Select your EV model to know its battery capacity and power consumption.
Objective: Provide a user-friendly tool to estimate the charging costs of EVs, promoting transparency and ease of use for prospective and current EV owners.

Calculator 3 - Savings Calculator

This calculator compares the monthly fuel costs of conventional vehicles with the electricity costs for EVs, displaying the total savings achieved by using an EV.

Usage:

Conventional Vehicle Fuel Cost: Enter the monthly fuel cost for your conventional vehicle.
EV Charging Cost: Input the monthly electricity cost for charging your EV.
Objective: To highlight the cost benefits of EVs over conventional vehicles, thereby encouraging users to consider making the switch to more sustainable vehicle options.
